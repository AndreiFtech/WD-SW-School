        <h1>Facts and History</h1>
        <h2>FEU Tech History</h2>
        <p>In 1936, the Commonwealth was two years old and independence was promised a decade hence. The FEU, a private education pioneer, took stock of <br>
          the emergent the nation's needs. Among its findings was a very pressing need for engineers and technologists to help build the nation. It felt itself <br>
          challenged and it thus established the Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>An increasing demand for trained engineers and technologists remained. With the government’s accelerated economic recovery program, private <br>
          businesses establishing more and more factories, and agriculture shifting to mechanization, the demand for trained and skilled personnel was <br>
          greater than ever. The Institute of Technology helped by filling the country’s needs in this respect.</p>
        <p>The renowned technical institutes and universities in the United States and 
        Europe, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of 
        Michigan, Cornell University, <br> and California Polytechnic, offered courses that led
        to a Bachelor of Science degree in a particular branch of engineering. These 
        courses were somewhat similar to those offered by <br> the Institute of Technology. 
        Nonetheless, they were tailored to the local environment and the demands of
        Philippine technical development.</p>
