        <h1>A New Technology</h1>
        <p>FEU takes pride in its continuous pursuit of academic excellence, which is why it regularly reviews its major tertiary programs. After a thorough evaluation of the Technology Program, the administration decided to <br>
            phase it out and replace it with a new computer technology program developed in collaboration with East Asia Computer Center, Inc. which began offering degrees in Computer Science in 1992. In July 1991, <br>
            SM Foundation and IBM Philippines established the Asia Pacific Computer Technology Center (APCTC). Six months later, APCTC partnered with Far Eastern University (FEU) and Intelligent Wave, Inc. (IWI) <br>
             to create a computer school, later named East Asia Computer Center, which was eventually renamed East Asia Institute of Computer Technology (EAICT). Initially, the only degree offered was the <br>
             Bachelor of Science in Computer and Information Science (BSCIS). In 1994, EAICT began offering the Bachelor of Science brin Computer Engineering (BSCOE).
        </p>
        <p>On September 30, 1998, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) officially recognized the renaming of East Asia Institute of Computer Technology (EAICT) to East Asia College of Information Technology (EACIT).</p>
        <p>On February 24, 2000, CHED designated EACIT as a Center of Development for Excellence (CODE) in Information Technology Education in the National Capital Region.</p>
        <p>In 2001, EACIT sought the approval of CHED to offer additional courses leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Bachelor of Science in Information Management. <br> Both courses gained full recognition in April 2004.</p>
        <p>In 2002, FEU obtained the majority shares of EACIT, gaining complete control of the college.</p>
        <p>In 2003, the FEU Administration made a significant move by merging the College of Engineering with East Asia College of Information Technology. The integration of resources and efforts from both colleges led to the <br>
            creation of FEU – East Asia College (FEU–EAC), accompanied by a revised vision and mission.</p>
